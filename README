This is the SDTS++ C++ toolkit, which can be used to write applications
that read and write SDTS datasets.  The current version is 1.5.1.

If you are working on a UNIX platform, you will need gcc 2.8.x or 3.x
to use this library.  You can get gcc at http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/.

If you are working on a Windows platform, you will need Visual C++ 6.0
to build and use this library.  The sdts++ project file is located in
``Windows/sdtsxx''.  There are also project files for the test
programs; however, you will have to add the ``sdtsxx'' dependency to
successfully link them.  (Apparently dependencies are not stored in
Visual C++ project files, but are instead kept in workspace files.)
Note that you MUST install the latest service pack to use sdts++ with
Visual C++.

You will need to have the Boost C++ header files installed.  They can
be procured from: http://www.boost.org/libraries.htm

Build and installation instructions can be found in the GNU texinfo
file "doc/sdts++.info".  That file also contains basic usage instructions.

Please consult the file BUGS for known problems and limitations with
the toolkit.

The TODO file lists pending work to be done on the library.

The file NEWS contains information on changes to SDTS++ by version.

"doc/sdts.ood" contains the Booch diagram of SDTS++'s design in Object
Domain format.  Object Domain can be found at "http://www.object-domain.com/".

"doc/SDTS++FAQ" contains frequently asked questions regarding SDTS++.

There is an electronic mailing list dedicated to SDTS software
development topics.  Please see the file "doc/SDTS++FAQ" to find out
how to subscribe to that mailing list.

See the file "COPYING" for details on support and licensing
information for sdts++.
