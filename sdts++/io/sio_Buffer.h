/**
 We needed something that would allow us to accumulate raw binary
 data in a convenient way.  That is, we'd like to add raw data a
 piece at a time to some sort of container.  This container would
 handle all the memory management for us.  This is that class.

 In a way, the name "sio_Buffer" is mis-leading.  We imply by using
 "buffer" that the intent is to arbitrarily add and 
 remove data in the container -- much like a stream.  However, we'll
 always be adding data to an sio_Buffer; and then asking its value
 in a non-destructive way.  That is, add and query, never add and remove.
