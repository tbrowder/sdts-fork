       *  \note
       *  Admittedly this is not an optimal design.  That
       *  is, it suffers the same problems as any container that has a
       *  single internal iterator instead of allowing for separate,
       *  external iterators.  However, I recognized that users of
       *  this class (or even generally the toolkit) intend to open
       *  SDTS files once, translate them to a meaningful format, and
       *  then forget about the original SDTS files.  It's "read once,
       *  and only once."  Given that paradigm, I felt confident to go
       *  ahead with this design.  MAC.

       *  \brief read a record into a builder module
       *
       *  Use the CATD information to find the corresponding module
       *  file, open it, read in the first record, and then use that
       *  record to populate the given module.  This will return false
       *  if there are no more records, the SDTS module file didn't
       *  exist, or there were some I/O or resource problems.  (E.g.,
       *  out of memory or a corrupted module.)  Will return true if
       *  the module was successfully populated.  This can be invoked
       *  multiple times for modules with more than one record; again
       *  get() will return false if all the module records have been
       *  read. The optional converter parameter is used to provide
       *  appropriate hints for reading binary data.
