   \note
  
         * Attribute subfields should have their mnemonic set to
         either "ATTP" or "ATTS", and their name set to the actual
         name of the attribute. Non- attribute subfields should have
         their mnemonic set to one of the subfield mnemonics defined
         by the SDTS. The name of a non-attribute subfield does not
         have to be set, and will not be if read from a transfer.

         Also, it's possible for a subfield to have a type, but have
         no value.  A subfield starts out this by default and can be
         set to this null state via the setUnvalued() member.  This
         is useful if you have to have a 'placeholder' subfield in
         an sc_Record that doesn't have any value at all.

   This class represents an SDTS Subfield. A Subfield has a value
   that is one of several types.

   Using one of the 'set' methods sets both the value *and* the
   type.  There is no way to set a value without setting the
   type. There is no way to "lock" the type; setting an instance to
   a new value with a different type will change the type associated
   with the instance.  This models the behavior of a variable whose
   type has run-time binding.  The type of the variable depends on
   the type of the value assigned to it.

   'get'ting the value of an instance will fail unless the member
   function corresponding to the current type of the instance is
   used.  For example, getting a string value for a subfield set as
   a BI32 will fail.

   An SDTS Subfield has the following attributes:
      Type:
         "The Data Type shall indicate the manner in which the subfield
         shall be encoded." -- The SDTS, section 4.2.1 "Specification Layout".
         The data type is one of:
            A: graphic characters, alphanumeric characters, or 
               alphabetic characters.
            I: implicit-point (integer)
            R: explicit-point unscaled (fixed point real)
            S: explicit-point scaled (floating point real)
            B: bitfield data
            C: character mode bitfield (binary in zero and one characters)
  
         The 'B' type may have additional qualification as follows:
            BI8:    8 bit signed integer
            BI16:   16 bit signed integer
            BI24:   24 bit signed integer
            BI32:   32 bit signed integer
            BUI:    unsigned integer, length specified by implementation
            BUI8:   8 bit unsigned integer
            BUI16:  16 bit unsigned integer
            BUI24:  24 bit unsigned integer
            BUI32:  32 bit unsigned integer
            BFP32:  32 bit floating point real
            BFP64:  64 bit floating point real

         In an sc_Subfield, the types listed above are actually
         stored using one of long, unsigned long, double, string or
         vector<char>. The mapping from SDTS data type to C++ is as
         follows:

            A                            string
            I                            long
            R,S                          double
            C                            Not Implemented
            BUI                          Not Implemented
            BI8, BI16, BI24, BI32        long
            BUI8, BUI16, BUI24, BUI32    unsigned long
            BFP32                        float
            BFP64                        double
  
      Value:
         The actual value stored in the Subfield.
  
      Name:
         A string representing the subfield name ("Module Name",
         "Record ID", etc).
  
      Mnemonic:
         A string representing the subfield mnemonic ("MODN", "RCID", etc).
