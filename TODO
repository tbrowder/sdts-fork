This being an incomplete enumeration of things that would be nice to
have in SDTS++.  If you would like to work on one of these, please
send e-mail to sdts_software-owner@mailrmon1.er.usgs.gov saying so to
insure that you're not duplicating someone else's efforts.


1. Better and more robust error handling

	Possibly something as simplistic as iostream's error handling
scheme.  For example, a reader could be in either a good(), bad(), or
fail() state.  Nice, but a bit parsiminous on error reporting.

        Note that an sio_Error mix-in class has been added; it needs
to be brought in to some of the classes, namely the top level classes
(i.e., sio_Reader and sio_Writer).


2. The I/O subsystem is in dire need of some re-design and re-implementation

   - eliminate use of C-style mem*() functions in converters
   - prefer use of references to pointers in converters
   - replace sio_Buffer and vector<char> with ios::streambuf for speed-up
   - rename converter member functions to something less confusing
   - ...

3. For logical layer, these need to be implemented:

   Link
 
   Circular arc, three point center
   Elliptical arc
   Uniform B-spline
   Piecewise Bezier

   Ring with mixed composition
   Ring composed of arcs

   However the arc types aren't used in most SDTS transfer, so there's
   no pressing need to implement those.

4. Replace use of ``sysutils'' package with boost filesystem

5. Eliminate deprecated sstream use and convert to stringstream.

6. Improve CMake build system to make more general.
